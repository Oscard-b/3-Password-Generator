# 3-Password-Generator

OVERVIEW
When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, it activates a series of prompts and alerts that will allow the user to choose whether they would like: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, or special characters included in their password, as well as choose the length of their password as long as it is between 8 and 128 characters

An array is then created based on the criteria from a list of options associated with each choice of criteria. This array, along with the password length that is chosen, will be used to create a password that will meet said criteria. Once the password is generated, it is written into the text area.

I wasn't able to figure out how to ensure that there would be at least one type of each selected character in the password
