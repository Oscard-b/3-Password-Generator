Password-Generator

# Description
When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, it activates a series of prompts and alerts that will allow the user to choose whether they would like: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, or special characters included in their password, as well as choose the length of their password as long as it is between 8 and 128 characters. After the last alert, the result password is displayed to the user.

I wasn't able to figure out how to ensure that there would be at least one type of each selected character in the password.
I also had problems with alerts popping up saying a certain type of character was approved to be included in the password when the user chooses for it not to be. The character isn't included though.
